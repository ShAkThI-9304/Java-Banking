# Java Banking Application

This is a Java-based banking application that simulates various banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and more. The application is designed to demonstrate core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and exception handling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several classes, each responsible for a specific functionality. Below is an overview of the classes and their purposes:

### 1. `Con.java`
This class likely serves as a connection or utility class, possibly handling database connections or other essential setup tasks for the application.

### 2. `BalanceEnquiry.java`
This class is responsible for handling balance inquiries. It allows users to check the current balance of their accounts.

### 3. `Deposit.java`
This class manages deposit operations. It provides functionality to add funds to a user's account.

### 4. `FastCash.java`
This class handles fast cash withdrawal operations, allowing users to quickly withdraw predefined amounts of money.

### 5. `Login.java`
This class manages user login functionality. It verifies user credentials and grants access to the banking system.

### 6. `Mini.java`
This class likely generates mini-statements, providing users with a summary of recent transactions.

### 7. `Pin.java`
This class is responsible for managing and updating the user's PIN (Personal Identification Number).

### 8. `Signup2.java`, `Signup3.java`, `Signupone.java`
These classes handle the multi-step user registration process. They collect and validate user information during account creation.

### 9. `Withdrawal.java`
This class manages standard withdrawal operations, allowing users to withdraw specified amounts from their accounts.

### 10. `main_Class.java`
This class contains the `main` method, serving as the entry point for the application. It orchestrates the overall flow and provides a user interface for interacting with the banking system.
